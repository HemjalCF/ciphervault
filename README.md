### Motivation: create and save password securely using AES encryption


Saving the password using thirdparty authentication methods are always insecure since the user didnot have access to the real source code.
If any password stored in the internet connected application then it is always risky, it doesnot matter whether the application is paid or not.
Here comes the idea of Cipher vault Application. Cipher vault is a C++ GUI application that saves the user name and password securely in the 
local machine in a encypted way. In this application, I used AES128 encryption algorithm.
